## üß© Detailed Prompt Strategy

### Prompt Structure Guidelines
- Each prompt focuses on a single, testable component
- Incrementally build complexity
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Specify testing requirements
- Ensure clean integration with previous work

### Prompt Generation Approach
1. Start with minimal viable implementation
2. Progressively add features
3. Maintain clean, modular architecture
4. Prioritize testability
5. Ensure smooth component integration

## üîç Key Considerations
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Modular, extensible design
- Performance optimization
- User experience focus
- Security and data privacy

## üìã Iteration Strategy
1. Implement smallest possible working version
2. Add complexity incrementally
3. Continuous integration
4. Robust testing at each stage
5. Refactor and optimize

## üöß Potential Challenges
- Complex spiral visualization
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Calendar sync complexity
- Performance with large datasets
- Maintaining smooth user experience

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Tools
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- State Management: Zustand
- Visualization: D3.js or PixiJS
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Firebase Auth
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library

## üìä Estimated Development Stages
1. Foundation: 2-3 weeks
2. User Management: 1-2 weeks
3. Event Management: 2-3 weeks
4. Calendar Sync: 2-3 weeks
5. Platform Optimization: 2-3 weeks

Total Estimated Development: 9-14 weeks
